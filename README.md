# Tailwind Material

Tailwind Material is a package designed specifically to generate color keys, their dark mode variants, varying states, and typography in sync with Material 3 styles. Crafted to perfectly integrate with your Tailwind theme, our package offers seamless alignment between material design and Tailwind utility classes, helping you build stunning and unified user interfaces effortlessly.

> Please note that this package is specifically tailored to create adjustable designs for hardware themes. It has not been thoroughly tested with a Tailwind theme that already contains various colors. Therefore, compatibility may not be guaranteed in such situations.
